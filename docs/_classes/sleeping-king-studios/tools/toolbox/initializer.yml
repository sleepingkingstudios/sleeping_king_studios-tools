  An initializer is used to set up the project, including loading
  configuration, setting initial data or states, and initializing
  dependencies.

  Using an initializer provides several advantages:

  - Potentially-expensive setup code is run on your own schedule, not when
    the module is first loaded.
  - The setup code will only run once, even if the initializer is called
    multiple times or from multiple places.
  - The setup code will only run once, even in a multi-threaded
    environment.
